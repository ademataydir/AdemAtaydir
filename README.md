###  About me

I’m Adem Ataydır, a passionate and motivated cybersecurity enthusiast.
I have been actively involved in the IT world for nearly 15 years. Throughout this time, I have performed numerous hardware and software installations and maintenance tasks on computer systems.

Most recently, I completed an intensive one-year cybersecurity training program, gaining hands-on experience with tools and concepts such as Firewalls, EDR, SIEM, and Penetration Testing. This was followed by a two-month internship, where I had the opportunity to apply and deepen my theoretical knowledge in practical settings.

I enjoy exploring cybersecurity systems, staying up to date with the latest technologies, and constantly improving my skills.

My ultimate goal is to become one of the top professionals in the field of cybersecurity.
